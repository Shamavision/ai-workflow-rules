# 🤖 AI Assistant: Read This First

## Project Context

This project uses **AI Workflow Rules Framework v7.1 Universal** — a set of rules for safe and efficient AI-assisted development.

**✨ New in v7.1:** Universal AGENTS.md support for automatic rule loading across all AI tools!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Universal)

**⚡ Fastest way to start any AI session:**

Just type `//START` in your first message and the AI will:
1. Read AGENTS.md automatically
2. Execute Session Start Protocol
3. Display `[SESSION START]` confirmation
4. Start working with full context

**✅ Works everywhere:** Claude Code CLI, VSCode Extension, Cursor, ChatGPT Web, Gemini, any AI tool!

---

## 📖 Automatic Loading (CLI/Cursor)

**Some AI tools load rules automatically from [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md):**

✅ **Full auto-load (CLI only):**
- Claude Code CLI (loads AGENTS.md + hooks work)
- Cursor (loads AGENTS.md)
- Windsurf (loads AGENTS.md)
- Continue.dev (loads AGENTS.md)
- Aider (loads AGENTS.md)

⚠️ **Partial support (AGENTS.md not auto-loaded, but CLAUDE.md works):**
- Claude Code VSCode Extension ✅ (Use `//START` - works via CLAUDE.md Layer 0!)
- OpenAI Codex (AGENTS.md support varies)
- Google Jules (AGENTS.md support varies)

💡 **Recommendation:** Use `//START` command to guarantee Session Start across all tools!
✨ **NEW:** VSCode Extension now fully supported via `.claude/CLAUDE.md` auto-loading!

## 📖 Manual Loading (Fallback)

### For AI tools WITHOUT AGENTS.md support (ChatGPT Web, etc.):

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Read the Core Rules
**File:** [`RULES_CORE.md`](RULES_CORE.md)

This file contains:
- Session Start Protocol (mandatory!)
- Token Management system
- Security best practices
- Git workflow and commit rules
- Communication protocol (language rules)

### 2. Read the Product Rules
**File:** [`RULES_PRODUCT.md`](RULES_PRODUCT.md)

This file contains:
- i18n architecture (Ukrainian market focus)
- Device adaptation (themes, accessibility)
- Ukrainian market policy (zero tolerance for russian services)
- SEO/GEO strategy
- Forbidden tracking services (40+ patterns)

### 3. Check Token Limits
**File:** [`.ai/token-limits.json`](.ai/token-limits.json)

This file contains:
- Your provider and plan settings
- Daily and monthly limits
- PRESETS for all major AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
- Automatic tracking configuration

**Note:** If token tracking doesn't apply to you (e.g., ChatGPT web), you can skip this.

### 4. Follow the Rules
All rules are **mandatory** during this session:
- Use Russian for internal dialogue (communication with user)
- Use English for code, comments, commit messages
- Never hardcode secrets
- Never use russian tracking services (see `.ai/forbidden-trackers.json`)
- Always discuss before coding
- Create roadmaps for complex tasks

---

## Important Notes

### For AI Tools WITH Automatic Loading (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
✅ You already loaded RULES from `AGENTS.md` automatically — this file is optional reference.

**Auto-loaded file:**
- `AGENTS.md` (universal standard) ⭐

### For ChatGPT Web / Gemini Web / Other Manual AI
⚠️ You need to **manually read** RULES at the start of each session:

**How to use:**
1. Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) or [`RULES_CORE.md`](RULES_CORE.md)
2. Tell the AI: "Follow these rules throughout our conversation"
3. Start working

### For GitHub Copilot
⚠️ Limited context support. Focus on:
- Security rules (no secrets, no russian trackers)
- Code quality standards
- Basic workflow (discuss before changing)
- Check AGENTS.md periodically for guidance

---

## Critical Security Rules

### 🚨 NEVER Do This:
- ❌ Hardcode API keys, secrets, passwords in code
- ❌ Use russian tracking services (Yandex Metrika, VK Pixel, Mail.ru, etc.)
- ❌ Use `.ru` domains in production config
- ❌ Commit secrets to Git
- ❌ Skip pre-commit hooks (they protect you!)

### ✅ ALWAYS Do This:
- ✅ Use `process.env.VAR` for secrets
- ✅ Check [`.ai/forbidden-trackers.json`](.ai/forbidden-trackers.json) before adding any tracking service
- ✅ Run `./scripts/seo-check.sh` before deploying
- ✅ Follow Ukrainian market policy (if applicable to project)

---

## What If I Violate a Rule?

**STOP immediately and ask the user:**
```
[RULE VIOLATION DETECTED]
Rule: [which rule was violated]
Action: [what you were about to do]
Risk: [why it's dangerous]

Should I:
A) Skip this action
B) Find alternative approach
C) Proceed anyway (user override)
```
