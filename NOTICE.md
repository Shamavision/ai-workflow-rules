# License Notice: GPL v3

## Why GPL v3?

This project is licensed under **GNU General Public License v3.0** for important reasons:

### 🎯 Our Goals

1. **Free for everyone** - Ukrainian businesses, developers, and community can use it freely
2. **Protect from reselling** - Prevent opportunists from taking our work and selling it
3. **Keep it open** - Any improvements must be shared back with the community
4. **Commercial use allowed** - Companies can use it in their projects without restrictions

### 🇺🇦 Made for Ukrainian Community

We created this framework to help Ukrainian businesses build better products. It's our contribution to the Ukrainian tech ecosystem. We chose GPL v3 to ensure it stays free and open forever.

**This is not about money. This is about protecting Ukrainian businesses and community.**

## What GPL v3 Means for You

### ✅ What You CAN Do

- ✅ **Use commercially** - Use in your startup, agency, or enterprise projects
- ✅ **Modify privately** - Adapt the framework to your needs (no obligation to share private changes)
- ✅ **Sell your services** - Use the framework in your commercial services/products
- ✅ **Use for clients** - Deploy for unlimited client projects
- ✅ **Keep your code private** - Your application code remains yours

**Example:**
```
Your Company builds e-commerce platform:
1. Uses ai-workflow-rules framework ✅
2. Develops your own React/Node.js code ✅
3. Keeps your application code private ✅
4. Sells your product/service ✅

Obligations: ZERO (if you don't modify the framework itself)
```

### ⚠️ What You CANNOT Do

- ❌ **Take and resell** - You cannot package this framework and sell it as your product
- ❌ **Close the source** - If you distribute modified framework, you must share changes
- ❌ **Remove attribution** - Keep copyright notices intact

**Example:**
```
Someone tries to:
1. Take our framework
2. Add "premium features"
3. Sell as "AI Workflow Pro" ($99)

GPL v3 requires: Share your changes publicly
Result: Why buy if code is public? Reselling becomes pointless 🎯
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to open-source my project if I use this framework?

**A: NO!** The framework is a **tool**, not a library. Your code stays private.

**Think of it like Git:**
- Git is GPL v2
- Do companies open-source their code because they use Git? NO!
- Same applies here - use the framework freely, keep your code private

### Q: When does GPL v3 require me to share code?

**A: Only if you:**
1. **Modify** the framework itself (hooks, scripts, rules)
2. **AND distribute** your modified version (sell, publish, give to others)

**If you use as-is:** No obligations whatsoever.

**If you modify privately:** No obligations (private use is free).

### Q: Can I use for commercial projects?

**A: YES!** Commercial use is fully allowed. Use in:
- Startups and enterprises
- Client projects (agencies)
- SaaS products
- Any commercial application

### Q: Can I sell services using this framework?

**A: YES!** You can:
- Charge clients for development services
- Build and sell products that use the framework
- Offer consulting/training
- Provide commercial support

The framework is your **tool** - you own your work.

### Q: What if my legal department fears GPL?

**A: Common misconception.** GPL v3 only applies to the framework code itself, not to projects using it.

**If concerns persist:** Contact us at opensource@wellme.ua - we can discuss your specific case.

## Real-World Scenarios

### ✅ Scenario 1: Startup Uses Framework

```
Company "Laba" builds fintech app:
- Uses ai-workflow-rules (pre-commit, rules, scripts) ✅
- Writes TypeScript/React code for their product ✅
- Keeps product code proprietary ✅
- Raises investment, sells to users ✅

GPL v3 obligations: NONE
```

### ✅ Scenario 2: Agency Serves Clients

```
Wellme builds 10 client projects:
- Uses framework on all projects ✅
- Each client gets private codebase ✅
- Framework = development tool ✅
- Client code stays confidential ✅

GPL v3 obligations: NONE
```

### ❌ Scenario 3: Someone Tries to Resell

```
"Smart" person takes framework:
- Adds "AI premium features"
- Packages as "Workflow Pro" ($99)
- GPL v3 kicks in: Must share changes publicly
- Buyers see: Why pay if code is free?
- Reselling fails 🎯

Result: Framework protected from exploitation
```

## Why This Matters

### The Problem We're Solving

Without GPL v3:
```
❌ Someone takes our free work
❌ Adds small changes
❌ Sells as closed-source product
❌ Ukrainian community loses access
❌ We did free work, someone else profits
```

With GPL v3:
```
✅ Ukrainian businesses use freely
✅ Commercial projects welcome
✅ Improvements stay open
✅ Reselling becomes impractical
✅ Community benefits forever
```

### Our Philosophy

We believe in:
- **Open source** - Knowledge should be shared
- **Community first** - Ukrainian tech ecosystem grows together
- **Fair use** - Use freely, but don't exploit
- **Copyleft protection** - Stay open forever

**We're not against making money. We're against taking community work and locking it behind paywalls.**

## Technical Details

### What GPL v3 Covers

```
✅ Covered by GPL v3:
- Pre-commit hooks (scripts/pre-commit)
- Shell scripts (scripts/*.sh)
- Framework rules (RULES_*.md, .ai/*.json)
- Documentation structure

❌ NOT covered:

### When Derivative Work Occurs

**Derivative work** (requires GPL v3 compliance):

- You fork the repo and sell modified version

**NOT derivative work** (no obligations):
- You use framework in your project
- You configure it for your needs
- You add your own hooks alongside ours
- You build products using the framework
