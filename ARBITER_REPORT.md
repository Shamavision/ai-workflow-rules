# ARBITER REPORT — Execution Plan
> Generated by /arbiter on 2026-02-22

## Executive Summary

There are 11 uncommitted files in working tree (Task 7) — **commit Task 7 first** before executing any proposal that touches already-modified files (P2.1 has collision risk with CLAUDE.md). After that, four proposals (P3.3 + P1.1 + P2.1 + P2.2) are quick wins executable in the current session (~17k tokens, ends at ~107k/200k). The largest work (P1.2 — install.sh redesign) is well-scoped but medium effort and should start in a fresh session. P2.3 (Cursor format) is **blocked on user verification** — if confirmed deprecated, it escalates from P2 to P1 and becomes urgent.

**Proposals analyzed:** 8 total
**🟢 Ready to execute:** 5 (after Task 7 commit)
**🟡 Needs review first:** 2
**🔴 Blocked:** 1

## ⚠️ Pre-Execution: Commit Task 7 First

**Current state: 11 uncommitted files.** Executing P2.1 (CLAUDE.md slim) without committing Task 7 creates a file collision on `.claude/CLAUDE.md`. The Arbiter requires a clean state before proceeding.

```
Action: commit Task 7 before any proposals
Files: scripts/post-push.sh, npm-templates/scripts/post-push.sh,
       .claude/CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, bin/cli.js,
       npm-templates/.claude/CLAUDE.md, npm-templates/AGENTS.md,
       CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md, PROJECT_CONTEXT_MAP.md
```

## Execution Queue (in order)

### Pre-Work — Commit Task 7 (MANDATORY FIRST)

| # | Action | Est. Tokens | Verdict |
|---|--------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Commit Task 7 (10 files) | ~2k | 🟢 Required before any proposals |

---

### Round 1 — Current session (quick wins, ~17k total)

*Execute after Task 7 commit. Independent, low-risk, max value.*

| # | Proposal | Type | Risk | Breaking | Est. Tokens | Verdict |
|---|---------|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | P3.3: Remove `task2.txt` + root debris | REMOVE | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~1k | 🟢 Ready |
| 2 | P1.1: Delete `.ai/token-limits.json` | REMOVE | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~3k | 🟢 Ready |
| 3 | P2.2: Sync guard in pre-commit hook | ADD | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~5k | 🟢 Ready |
| 4 | P2.1: Slim CLAUDE.md (remove 2 stale sections) | REMOVE | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~8k | 🟢 Ready (after Task 7 commit) |

**Session budget after Round 1:** ~90k + 17k = ~107k (54%) — yellow zone, still viable.

---

### Round 2 — Fresh session (medium effort)

*Start fresh — install.sh redesign needs focused context.*

| # | Proposal | Type | Risk | Breaking | Est. Tokens | Verdict |
|---|---------|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 5 | P1.2: Redesign `install.sh` (Wizard Redesign Backlog) | RESTRUCTURE | 🟡 Medium | 🟡 Soft-breaking | ~25k (±50%) | 🟢 Ready |
| 6 | P3.1: `/pipeline` skill | ADD | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~5k | 🟢 Ready |

**Session budget for Round 2:** ~25-35k total — fits easily in a fresh session.

---

### Round 3 — After Round 2 complete

*P3.2 requires P1.2 done first. P2.3 requires user verification.*

| # | Proposal | Type | Risk | Breaking | Est. Tokens | Verdict |
|---|---------|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 7 | P3.2: `install.ps1` (Windows installer) | ADD | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~15k | 🟡 After P1.2 |
| 8 | P2.3: Cursor format verification + migration | VERIFY→ADD | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~3-8k | 🔴 Blocked |

---

## Dependency Map

```
[P3.3]  → no dependencies        → Round 1, first (5 min)
[P1.1]  → no dependencies        → Round 1, second (30 min)
[P2.2]  → no dependencies        → Round 1, third (1h)
[P2.1]  → requires Task 7 commit → Round 1, LAST (30 min, collision risk otherwise)
[P1.2]  → no hard deps, but HIGH effort → Round 2 (fresh session)
[P3.1]  → stable skills triangle  → Round 2 (can follow P1.2 same session)
[P3.2]  → requires P1.2 complete → Round 3
[P2.3]  → requires USER VERIFY   → Round 3 (or upgrades to P1 if Cursor deprecated)
```

## Breaking Changes Register

| Proposal | Breaking Type | Impact | Migration Required |
|---------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| P1.1 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Dev project only — users get fresh token-limits.json at install | No |
| P2.1 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Removes 2 informational sections from CLAUDE.md — AI behavior unchanged | No |
| P2.2 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Adds warning to pre-commit — existing commits unaffected | No |
| P1.2 | 🟡 Soft-breaking | Removes dead wizard questions (teamSize, tokenPriority) — note in CHANGELOG | Mention in CHANGELOG |
| P2.3 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Additive: keep `.cursorrules` + add `.cursor/rules/` | No |
| P3.3 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Untracked dev file only | No |
| P3.1 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Additive new skill | No |
| P3.2 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Additive new file | No |

## Risk Register

| Proposal | Risk Level | Blast Radius | Reversibility | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| P3.3 | 🟢 Low | 1 untracked file | Easy | Trivial |
| P1.1 | 🟢 Low | 1 dev file | Easy | presets.json is full replacement |
| P2.2 | 🟡 Medium | pre-commit × 2 (dev + npm-templates) | Easy | Must sync both copies — easy to miss |
| P2.1 | 🟡 Medium | CLAUDE.md × 2 (dev + npm-templates) | Easy | Affects every user session; collision risk if Task 7 not committed first |
| P2.3 | 🟡 Medium [ESTIMATE] | Unknown until verified | Easy | If confirmed: adds .cursor/rules/ dir + installer change |
| P1.2 | 🟡 Medium | install.sh (1 file) | Easy | Decisions documented; soft-breaking for dead wizard questions |
| P3.1 | 🟢 Low | 2 new files | Easy | Additive |
| P3.2 | 🟢 Low | 1 new file | Easy | Depends on P1.2 design |

| P1.1 (token-limits.json) | ~2k | ~1k | ~3k | Minimal |
| P2.2 (sync guard) | ~3k | ~2k | ~5k | Small |
| P2.1 (slim CLAUDE.md) | ~5k | ~3k | ~8k | Small |
| **Round 1 total** | | | **~17k** | **~107k (54%) ← Yellow zone entry** |
| P1.2 (install.sh redesign) | ~10k | ~15k | ~25k ±50% | Medium — fresh session |
| P3.1 (/pipeline) | ~2k | ~3k | ~5k | Small |
| **Round 2 total** | | | **~30k** | **~55k from session start (28%)** |
| P3.2 (install.ps1) | ~3k | ~12k | ~15k | Medium |
| P2.3 (Cursor verify) | ~3k | ~5k | ~3-8k | Small |
| **All proposals total** | | | **~65k** | **Fits in 2 sessions comfortably** |

## Arbiter's Recommendations

**Execute NOW (this session, after Task 7 commit):**
1. Commit Task 7 first (~2k)
2. P3.3 — Delete `task2.txt` (5 min)
3. P1.1 — Delete `.ai/token-limits.json` (30 min)
4. P2.2 — Sync guard in pre-commit hook (1h)
5. P2.1 — Slim CLAUDE.md: remove "File Structure Reference" + "What's New v9.1" (30 min)
6. Commit + push Round 1

**Discuss before executing (P2.3 — CRITICAL question for user):**
> "Does Cursor in your version still read `.cursorrules`?
> Check: Settings → Rules or open a Cursor project with `.cursorrules` and verify rules appear.
> If NO → P2.3 escalates to P1 and should enter Round 1 of next session."

**Execute in fresh session (Round 2):**
- P1.2 — install.sh Wizard Redesign (biggest remaining work, needs focused context)
- P3.1 — /pipeline skill (quick win after P1.2)

**Do not execute until P1.2 complete:**
- P3.2 — install.ps1 (must be based on redesigned install.sh, not the broken one)

---

## What the Arbiter Won't Order

**P2.3 without user verification.** The Cursor format question cannot be scheduled because the blast radius is unknown. If `.cursorrules` is still supported (likely for Cursor <1.0 versions), implementation is small. If deprecated, it means ALL current Cursor users get zero rules silently — which would make it a P1 item requiring immediate action. The Arbiter cannot score this without that one piece of user information.

**P3.2 before P1.2.** Writing install.ps1 before redesigning install.sh would mean basing the Windows installer on broken logic. The Arbiter refuses to schedule building on a broken foundation.

---

## Documentation Fix (execute in passing during Round 1)

`PROJECT_CONTEXT_MAP.md` line 49 says **"2 pairs: Claude Code + Cursor"** but reality is **3 pairs** (Claude Code + Cursor + AGENTS.md/any AI). Fix this one-liner when updating the map.
