## Executive Summary

All 6 executable proposals are low-to-medium risk and non-breaking. The entire P1+P2 cleanup sprint (~37k tokens) can be executed in a single session and committed in two atomic commits. No proposals require major-version bumps or migration guides for users.

**Critical arbiter finding:** P3.1 ("Complete the Triangle — /arbiter") is **factually moot**. The arbiter skill is already fully implemented (370 lines, 7 complete steps, successfully executed right now). P3.1 is CLOSED. This was a sculptor error based on outdated context.

**Hidden scope in P1.1:** The sculptor's scripts purge only targets `scripts/` — but `scripts/token-status.sh` has a dual-structure mirror at `npm-templates/scripts/`. The purge must extend to npm-templates mirrors. Verify `ls npm-templates/scripts/` before executing.

**Pre-condition:** Commit current 10 uncommitted files before starting cleanup sprint. Clean tree = safe deletions.

**Proposals analyzed:** 8 total
**🟢 Ready to execute:** 6
**🟡 Hold:** 1 (P3.2 — YAGNI condition not met)
**✅ Closed:** 1 (P3.1 — already done)

## Arbiter vs Sculptor: Where We Disagree

| Proposal | Sculptor's View | Arbiter's Verdict | Reason |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| P3.1 | "HIGHEST STRATEGIC PRIORITY — missing/stub" | ✅ **CLOSED** | arbiter.md already fully implemented (370 lines, 7 steps). Sculptor analyzed stale context. |
| P3.2 | "Schedule after arbiter" | 🟡 **Hold — conditional** | YAGNI: schedule ONLY when ≥2 new skills added. Current 3-skill list is stable. |
| P2.2 (CHANGELOG) | "Separate Phase, do after cleanup" | 🟢 **Merge into Round 1** | Write CHANGELOG last in Round 1 so it covers the cleanup commit itself. |
| P1.1 scope | "Delete 24 scripts from scripts/" | 🟡 **Wider scope** [VERIFY] | npm-templates mirrors of deleted scripts must also be purged (dual-structure invariant). |

## Execution Queue

### Round 1 — Cleanup Sprint
*All proposals independent. Execute in order below. Single commit at end.*

| # | Proposal | Type | Risk | Breaking | Est. Tokens | Verdict |
|---|---------|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | P1.3: Runtime files out of npm-templates | REMOVE | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~3k | 🟢 Ready |
| 2 | P1.2: config.json cleanup (×2 dual) | RESTRUCTURE | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~4k | 🟢 Ready |
| 3 | P2.1: Delete QUICK_CONTEXT.md | REMOVE | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~6k | 🟢 Ready [VERIFY refs] |
| 4 | P1.1: Scripts purge + npm-templates mirrors | REMOVE | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~5k | 🟢 Ready [VERIFY mirrors] |
| 5 | P2.2: CHANGELOG catch-up | ADD | 🟢 Low | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~6k | 🟢 Ready (do last) |

→ **Commit:** `chore(cleanup): scripts purge + config cleanup + dead files`
→ **Round 1 total:** ~24k tokens (estimate ±50%)

---

### Round 2 — Content Update
*After Round 1 committed. Separate session OK.*

| # | Proposal | Type | Risk | Breaking | Est. Tokens | Verdict |
|---|---------|------|------|----------|-------------|---------|
| 6 | P2.3: AGENTS.md update (×2 dual) | RESTRUCTURE | 🟡 Medium | 🟢 Non-breaking | ~13k | 🟢 Ready |

→ **Commit:** `docs(agents): reflect current workflow + skills triangle`
→ **Round 2 total:** ~13k tokens (estimate ±50%)

---

### On Hold

| Proposal | Condition to Unblock |
|---------|---------------------|
| P3.2: File pair manifest | Execute ONLY when ≥2 new skills are added to the triangle. Current list is stable (3 skills). YAGNI applies. |

---

### Closed

| Proposal | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| P3.1: /arbiter skill | ✅ Already fully implemented. 370-line skill, 7 steps, successfully executed today. Remove from ROADMAP backlog. |

## Dependency Map

```
[P1.3]  → no dependencies → start here
[P1.2]  → no dependencies → parallel with P1.3
[P2.1]  → VERIFY refs first → then delete
[P1.1]  → VERIFY npm-templates mirrors first → delete dev + mirrors
[P2.2]  → do LAST in Round 1 (covers the whole cleanup in its entry)
──────
[P2.3]  → after Round 1 committed
──────
[P3.2]  → blocked by YAGNI condition → not scheduled
[P3.1]  → CLOSED
```

## Breaking Changes Register

| Proposal | Breaking Type | User Impact | Migration |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| P1.1 | 🟡 Soft (docs only) | Dead links to scripts/install.ps1 in old docs. Active users unaffected. | No |
| P1.2 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Dead `token_budget` block removed — no code reads it | No |
| P1.3 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Installer never copies these files | No |
| P2.1 | 🟢 Non-breaking | No code imports QUICK_CONTEXT.md | No [VERIFY refs] |
| P2.2 | 🟢 Non-breaking | Additive changelog entries only | No |
| P2.3 | 🟢 Non-breaking | AGENTS.md becomes more accurate | No |

---

## Risk Register

| Proposal | Risk | Blast Radius | Reversibility | Notes |
|---------|------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| P1.1 | 🟢 Low | scripts/ + mirrors | Easy | [VERIFY] npm-templates mirrors before deleting |
| P1.2 | 🟡 Medium | config.json ×2 | Easy | Dual-structure — both files required |
| P1.3 | 🟢 Low | 2 files in npm-templates/.ai/ | Easy | |
| P2.1 | 🟢 Low | 1 file + ref cleanup | Easy | [VERIFY] CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md |
| P2.2 | 🟢 Low | CHANGELOG.md only | Easy | |
| P2.3 | 🟡 Medium | AGENTS.md ×2 | Easy | Dual-structure — both files required |
| P3.2 | 🟡 Medium | 3 files refactored + new file | Easy | HELD — YAGNI |

---

## Token Budget

| Scope | Tokens (±50%) | Session Fit |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| Round 1 (5 proposals) | ~24k | ✅ Safe |
| Round 2 (1 proposal) | ~13k | ✅ Safe |
| All together | ~37k | ✅ Fits comfortably |
| P3.2 if unblocked (future) | +~35k | ⚠️ Budget check needed |

## Arbiter's Recommendations

**Before any cleanup — commit current work first:**
```
git add PROJECT_IDEOLOGY.md npm-templates/PROJECT_IDEOLOGY.md
     .claude/commands/arbiter.md npm-templates/.claude/commands/arbiter.md
     .claude/commands/ctx.md npm-templates/.claude/commands/ctx.md
     bin/cli.js scripts/install.sh PROJECT_CONTEXT_MAP.md PROPOSALS.md ARBITER_REPORT.md
git commit -m "feat(session): ideology + arbiter improvements + full /ctx scan"
```

**Then execute Round 1 in order:**
1. Delete `npm-templates/.ai/token-limits.json` + `session-log.json` (P1.3)
2. Edit `config.json` + `npm-templates/.ai/config.json` — remove `token_budget`, `modules`, set `config_version: "2.2"` (P1.2)
3. Read `QUICK_CONTEXT.md` → verify no refs → delete (P2.1)
4. Run `ls npm-templates/scripts/` → identify mirrors → `git rm` all 24 legacy scripts + their mirrors (P1.1)
5. Add CHANGELOG entries for Rounds 2+3 (P2.2)
6. Commit Round 1

**Then execute Round 2:**
7. Read + rewrite both `AGENTS.md` versions — skills triangle, PROJECT_IDEOLOGY.md, session anchor (P2.3)
8. Commit Round 2

**Do not schedule:**
- P3.2: revisit when 2+ new skills are added

**Close permanently:**
- P3.1: remove from ROADMAP. /arbiter is done.

## What the Arbiter Won't Order

**P3.1 — rejected as factually incorrect:**
The sculptor stated arbiter is "a stub skill, but not implemented." This is false. The skill was implemented in a prior session and contains 370 lines and 7 complete steps. This very report is evidence of the skill running. The Arbiter explicitly closes P3.1.

**P3.2 — not scheduled (YAGNI):**
Adding manifest.json + refactoring 3 working files solves a problem that doesn't exist today. The current 3-skill file list is stable. PRINCIPLE #3 from PROJECT_IDEOLOGY.md: *"Less is more (YAGNI) — remove more than you add. Every file must earn its place."* Manifest doesn't earn its place until the list grows to 5+ pairs. Revisit when that happens.
