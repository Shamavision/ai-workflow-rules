# PROJECT IDEOLOGY
> Created via `npx @shamavision/ai-workflow-rules` on [INSTALL_DATE].
> Append-only. Update with `/ctx ideology` or `/ctx update` — never overwrite manually.
> This document captures WHY your project exists and the decisions that define it.
>
> **Quick start:** Fill in the sections below, then run `/ctx` to generate
> `PROJECT_CONTEXT_MAP.md` and keep this file updated automatically.

## [v1.0] [DATE] — Initial Ideology Capture

### WHY — Core Purpose

[1-3 sentences: the fundamental problem your project solves.
NOT what it does mechanically — WHY it matters to the people who use it.]

---

### WHO — Primary User

[Describe the primary user in 2-3 sentences.
Their context, their pain, what they need. Be specific — not "developers" but what kind.]

---

### PRODUCT — What It Delivers (Concrete)

[Describe what your project actually delivers to users. Be specific — not philosophy, but tangible output.
This section makes PROJECT_IDEOLOGY.md useful for writing README, landing pages, and pitches.

Examples:
- Tool: "Run X command → get Y files that do Z in 2 minutes"
- SaaS: "Sign up → get dashboard with A, B, C features"
- Library: "import X, call Y() → achieve Z with 3 lines of code"
- API: "POST /endpoint → returns structured data for use case W"]

**Key capabilities:**
- [Feature 1 — concrete, not abstract]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]

**What users get after installation/setup:**
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

**Key differentiator vs alternatives:**
[One sentence: why someone would choose this over the obvious alternative]

---

### PRINCIPLES — Non-Negotiable Rules

- [Principle 1 — e.g. "Quality > Speed — always"]
- [Principle 2 — e.g. "Mobile-first — no exceptions"]
- [Principle 3 — e.g. "No tracking without explicit consent"]

---

### ANTI-GOALS — What This Project Is NOT

- [Not X — e.g. "Not a generic solution for all markets"]
- [Not Y — e.g. "Not enterprise-first"]
- [Not Z — e.g. "Not a plugin ecosystem"]

---

### DECISIONS — Architectural Choices Locked In

- **Decision:** [What was decided]
  **Rationale:** [Why — the tradeoff considered]
  **Alternatives rejected:** [What was not chosen]

---

### VISION — Where This Is Going

[1-3 sentences: what does this project look like when it's "done"?
What would make you say "yes, this is exactly what I wanted"?]

> **Next steps:**
> 1. Fill in the sections above (replace all `[placeholders]`)
> 2. Run `/ctx` to generate `PROJECT_CONTEXT_MAP.md` (full architecture snapshot)
> 3. Run `/ctx ideology` any time to capture new decisions and market changes
> 4. Run `/sculptor` for architectural analysis, `/arbiter` for execution planning
