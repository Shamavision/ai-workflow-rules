```

**How to Verify:**
```bash
# On Linux/Mac:
sha256sum RULES_CORE.md

# On Windows (PowerShell):
Get-FileHash RULES_CORE.md -Algorithm SHA256

## 🚨 ANTI-COUNTERFEITING MEASURES

This Software includes multiple layers of anti-counterfeiting protection:

### 1. License Key Validation
Each copy is tied to a unique license key that must be activated via:
```bash
./scripts/activate-license.sh
```

**Counterfeit indicators:**
- ❌ No license key provided
- ❌ License activation script missing or disabled
- ❌ Generic/fake license keys (e.g., "XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX")

### 2. Cryptographic Hashing
All critical files are hashed (SHA-256). Any modification invalidates the hash.

**Counterfeit indicators:**
- ❌ Checksums don't match
- ❌ `verify-authenticity.sh` script removed or bypassed

### 3. Digital Signatures
Releases are PGP-signed with our private key.

**Counterfeit indicators:**
- ❌ Missing `.sig` signature files
- ❌ Signature verification fails

### 4. Watermarking
Internal metadata is embedded in RULES files (invisible to users, detectable by us).

**Counterfeit indicators:**
- ❌ Metadata removed or altered
- ❌ RULES files copied from public repositories without authorization

### 5. Certificate Chain
This certificate references our official website and PGP key, both verifiable.

**Counterfeit indicators:**
- ❌ Certificate points to unknown/fake website
- ❌ PGP key fingerprint doesn't match official key
