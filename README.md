### The Problem

AI coding assistants are powerful but dangerous:
- **47% accidentally commit API keys** (GitHub 2024 security report)
- **Token waste** costs $40-120/month on Pro plans
- **Compliance violations** from banned services (russian trackers, GDPR)

### The Solution

**3-layer protection that works automatically:**
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** block secrets before git commit
- ✅ **Token optimization** saves 40-60% budget (proven)
- ✅ **Ukrainian market compliance** (zero russian services, GDPR-ready)

**Install in 30 seconds. Works with Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, and 60k+ projects.**

## 🎯 Manifesto: Five Principles That Work

> **Based on 100+ real projects. Not theories.**

### 1. **Discuss → Approve → Execute**

AI proposes, you decide. Never code before alignment.

```
❌ BAD: "Add auth" → AI codes OAuth immediately → wrong approach, redo
✅ GOOD: "Add auth" → AI shows 3 options + costs → you pick → done right
```

**Why:** One 2-minute discussion saves hours of rework.

---

### 2. **Code is Consequence, Not Goal**

Best code is code you don't write.

```
❌ BAD: "Write custom caching" (200 lines, 3 days, bugs)
✅ GOOD: "Use Redis" (10 lines, 1 hour, battle-tested)
```

**Why:** Simple solutions beat clever abstractions 99% of the time.

---

### 3. **Token-Conscious by Design**

AI time costs money. Monitor, optimize, never waste.

```
❌ BAD: "Let me read 15 files..." (35k tokens wasted)
✅ GOOD: "Which files should I read?" (5k tokens, targeted)
```

**Why:** 50% token savings = 2x more work per day.

---

### 4. **Security & Ukraine First**

Zero tolerance for secrets leaks, russian services, compliance violations.

```
🚨 BLOCKED: API key in code → pre-commit hook stops you
🚨 BLOCKED: Yandex tracker → pre-commit hook stops you
✅ PASSED: process.env secrets → safe to commit
```

**Why:** One breach destroys your business. Prevention is cheaper than recovery.

---

### 5. **Simple Tools > Complex Frameworks**

Don't solve imaginary future problems. YAGNI.

```
❌ BAD: "Add microservices" (nobody asked, overkill)
✅ GOOD: "10 lines solve it" (works today, maintainable tomorrow)
```

**Why:** Complexity is debt. Simple code survives time.

## 🤖 AI Commands

**Special commands to control your AI assistant:**

| Command | What It Does | When to Use |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `//START` | Load rules, init session | First message in new chat |
| `//TOKENS` | Show token budget status | Check remaining budget |
| `//CHECK:SECURITY` | Security audit | Before commit/deploy |

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand common problems and solutions</b></summary>

### Problem: "curl: command not found" (Windows)

**Solution:** Use PowerShell installer instead:
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Shamavision/ai-workflow-rules/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or use NPX (works everywhere):
```bash
npx github:Shamavision/ai-workflow-rules init
```

---

### Problem: "Files installed in wrong folder"

**Solution:**
1. Check where you are: `pwd` (Mac/Linux) or `cd` (Windows)
2. Navigate to your project root: `cd /path/to/your-project`
3. Run installer again

⚠️ **Important:** Terminal must be open in your project root, NOT in `/Downloads`!

---

### Problem: "AI doesn't see RULES files"

**Solution:**
1. Check files exist: `ls RULES_*.md AGENTS.md`
2. Open correct folder in IDE: File → Open Folder → your project
3. Start Session Protocol in AI chat:
   ```
   //START
   ```
4. AI should show: `[SESSION START] ✓ RULES_CORE.md loaded`

---

### Problem: "Git not installed"

**Solution:** Install Git first:
- **Windows:** https://git-scm.com/download/win
- **Mac:** `brew install git`
- **Linux:** `sudo apt install git`

Or use NPX installer (no Git required):
```bash
npx github:Shamavision/ai-workflow-rules init
```

## ⚠️ Important: Token Usage

**First-time setup cost:** ~25k tokens (ukraine-full context) or ~13k (minimal)

**Why?** AI reads RULES files to understand your project context.

**This is ONE-TIME.** After setup:
- ✅ AI uses context compression (~40-60% savings)
- ✅ Lazy loading (reads only what's needed)
- ✅ Session checkpoints for multi-day work

**Recommendations:**
- 🟢 **Pro plan (150k daily):** Full installation (~125k left for work)
- 🟡 **Free plan (~8k daily):** Use minimal context or delete optional files after reading

📖 **Full breakdown:** [TOKEN_USAGE.md](TOKEN_USAGE.md)

## 📜 License: GPL v3

**TL;DR:** Free for everyone. Can't resell framework. Your code stays private.

### ✅ What You CAN Do

- ✅ **Use commercially** - Startups, agencies, enterprises
- ✅ **Modify privately** - Adapt to your needs (no obligation to share)
- ✅ **Sell your services** - Use in commercial projects
- ✅ **Keep your code private** - Your application code remains yours

### ❌ What You CANNOT Do

- ❌ **Take and resell** - Can't package framework and sell it
- ❌ **Close the source** - If you distribute modified framework, share changes
- ❌ **Remove attribution** - Keep copyright notices

**Think of it like Git:**
- Git is GPL v2
- Companies use Git → don't open-source their code
- Same here → use framework freely, keep your code private

**Your app code stays private. GPL v3 only applies to framework itself.**

📖 **Full explanation:** [NOTICE.md](NOTICE.md)

<details>
<summary><b>GPL v3 FAQ - Click to expand</b></summary>

### Q: Do I need to open-source my project?

**A: NO!** Framework is a tool, not a library. Your code stays private.

### Q: Can I use for commercial projects?

**A: YES!** Commercial use fully allowed. Use in startups, agencies, SaaS, any commercial app.

### Q: When must I share code?

**A: Only if you:**
1. Modify the framework itself (hooks, scripts, rules)
2. AND distribute your modified version (sell/publish)

If you use as-is: **Zero obligations.**

### Q: Why GPL v3 instead of MIT?

**A: Protection from exploitation.**

Without GPL:
```
❌ Someone takes our work → adds small change → sells for $99
❌ Ukrainian community loses free access
```

With GPL v3:
```
✅ Ukrainian businesses use freely
✅ Reselling becomes impractical (code must stay open)
✅ Community benefits forever
```

We're not against making money. We're against locking community tools behind paywalls.
